Install cmc
===========

1. `Install Homebrew`_ â€” The missing package manager for macOS
2. Add this "tap" and install ``cmc``::

    brew tap ClockworkNet/cmc
    brew install cmc

If this utility is helpful for you, please star the cmc project below so that
it can eventually be included in Homebrew proper. Thank you!
